# LeadMarka marketing site

Static landing page for LeadMarka. No build step—just HTML, CSS, and assets.

**Deploy:** See [../MARKETING_DEPLOYMENT.md](../MARKETING_DEPLOYMENT.md) for Vercel (or other host) setup. Use root directory `leadmarka-crm/marketing`.

**Edit app links:** Update `index.html` so “Log in”, “Get started free”, “Terms”, and “Privacy” point to your real CRM app URL and paths.

**Feature screenshots:** Placeholders are in `assets/screenshots/` (leads.svg, reminders.svg, dashboard.svg). To use real app screenshots, replace with PNGs/JPGs (e.g. `leads.png`) and update the `src` in `index.html`. Recommended size: ~800×520px for retina.
