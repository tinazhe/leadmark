# WhatsApp Account Restriction – How to Request a Review

## What Meta support said

Meta support confirmed that your **Business Suite portfolio is in good standing** and that the **only active restriction is on your WhatsApp account**. Because WhatsApp runs on a separate system, they don’t have visibility into the reason and **you need to contact WhatsApp Support directly** using the methods below.

---

## Direct WhatsApp appeal options (use these)

**If your number doesn’t have the WhatsApp app** (e.g. you use the number only via the API / Cloud API / Business Suite), the **in-app “Request a review”** flow won’t work. Use the **contact form** and **email** below instead.

Use WhatsApp’s **official channels** and provide your **account details**: business name (Yuri Digital), **WhatsApp Business account ID** (103451455714376 or 1206688904965749), and the **phone number in international format** (e.g. +263… for Zimbabwe).

### 1. Official contact form (works without the app)

- **URL:** **https://www.whatsapp.com/contact/noclient**
- Enter your **business phone number in international format** (e.g. +263XXXXXXXXX).
- In the message field, **describe your situation** (use the appeal text at the bottom of this guide).
- Include the **WhatsApp Business account ID**: 1206688904965749 (or 103451455714376 if that’s the one you’re appealing).

### 2. Email (works without the app)

- **WhatsApp Business:** **smb_web@support.whatsapp.com** (best for Business API/Cloud accounts)
- **General support:** **support@whatsapp.com**

Send your appeal message (see below). In the email include:
- Subject line: e.g. *Request to review restricted WhatsApp Business account – Yuri Digital*
- **WhatsApp Business account ID(s)**: 1206688904965749 and/or 103451455714376
- **Phone number(s)** in international format
- The full appeal text (compliance steps, request for reinstatement)

### 3. In-app (only if the number has the app)

- If the restricted number **does** have WhatsApp installed (app or web), you can open WhatsApp, enter that number, and tap **“Request a review”**.  
- If you use the number only via API/Cloud (no app on that number), **skip this** and use the form or email above.

## You’re on the right page – but Meta doesn’t show “Request review” here

If you’re on the **WhatsApp account** page (Overview → Business portfolio → WhatsApp account) for **Yuri Digital Marketing** (ID: 1206688904965749) and you only see:

- **“What you can do”** → **“Start chat”** (to contact business support)

then **this is normal**. On this asset page, Meta often does **not** show a “Request review” button for WhatsApp restrictions. They handle WhatsApp separately.

**What to do from here:**

1. **Use WhatsApp’s channels that work without the app:**
   - **Contact form:** **https://www.whatsapp.com/contact/noclient** — enter your business number in international format and paste your appeal text (include account ID 1206688904965749).
   - **Email:** **smb_web@support.whatsapp.com** (WhatsApp Business) — send your appeal with account ID and number in international format. You can also try **support@whatsapp.com**.
   - (In-app “Request a review” only works if that number has the WhatsApp app; for API/Cloud-only numbers, use the form or email.)

2. **Optional:** Click **“Start chat”** if you want to ask Meta again; they will direct you to WhatsApp Support (form or email for your case).

So: **you don’t need to find another button on this page.** Use the **Direct WhatsApp options** above to submit your appeal.

---

## Via Meta Business Support Home (alternative)

**There is no separate “appeal form” URL** on Meta’s side. For some accounts, **Request review** can appear in **“What you can do”** when you open the restricted account from Business Support Home—but for your WhatsApp account, that option often isn’t shown. In that case, use the **Direct WhatsApp options** at the top of this guide.

---

## Step-by-step (get to the appeal)

1. **Open Business Support Home**  
   - Go to: **https://business.facebook.com/business-support-home**  
   - Make sure you’re logged in as an **admin** on the Yuri Digital business.

2. **See all account issues**  
   - On the main page you’ll see **“Recent account issues”** and a note:  
     **“If you need to see all of your account and asset issues, go to My Accounts.”**  
   - Click **“My Accounts”** (or use the left menu and look for **“Account status overview”**).

3. **Select the restricted WhatsApp account**  
   - In the list of accounts, find the **restricted WhatsApp account** (e.g. “Lead Marka” or “Yuri Digital Marketing” / IDs 103451455714376 or 1206688904965749).  
   - Click that account so you open its details.

4. **Request review**  
   - On that account’s page, find the section **“What you can do”**.  
   - Click **“Request review”** (or “View details in Business Support Home” if that appears first, then look for **“Request review”** there).

5. **Complete the flow**  
   - Confirm you’re a real person (e.g. checkbox).  
   - Enter the phone number where you want to receive a code (SMS or WhatsApp).  
   - Enter the code and continue.  
   - Upload a **photo ID** (passport, driver’s licence, or government-issued ID) if asked.  
   - Submit the request.

**Note:** You must be an **admin** on the account to request a review. Appeals are typically reviewed within about **48 hours** (sometimes longer). Policy violations are usually appealable within **90 days** of the restriction.

## Alternative path (same destination)

- **Account Quality**  
  - **https://business.facebook.com/accountquality**  
  - This often redirects to Business Support Home. From there, use **“Account status overview”** or **“My Accounts”**, then select the restricted WhatsApp account and use **“Request review”** in **“What you can do”**.

- From your **Account Overview** (e.g. Business portfolio → WhatsApp account), the **“Open in WhatsApp Manager”** button can take you to management views; the actual **Request review** option is still reached via **Business Support Home** → select the restricted account → **“What you can do”** → **“Request review”**.

---

## Text you can use in the appeal

When the flow asks for a reason or additional details, you can use (or adapt) this:

---

**Subject / summary:**  
Request for review of WhatsApp account restriction – Yuri Digital (ID: 103451455714376).

**Message:**

We would like to formally request a review of the restriction on the WhatsApp account Yuri Digital (ID: 103451455714376).

We understand that the restriction was triggered by activity during early setup and testing. Since then, we have taken corrective action and aligned our processes with the WhatsApp Business Terms of Service.

- We have paused all outbound messaging.  
- We will only message users who have explicitly opted in.  
- Our use of WhatsApp is strictly for customer communication and support.  
- We have reviewed and adjusted our workflows to ensure full compliance going forward.

We respectfully request that the account be reviewed and that messaging capabilities be reinstated.

Kind regards,  
Yuri Digital Marketing  
Zimbabwe

## If you still don’t see “Request review”

- Ensure you’re in **Business Support Home** (or **Account Quality** that redirects there).  
- Use **“My Accounts”** or **“Account status overview”** so you see **all** issues, not only “last 30 days” (your restriction is from Nov 2023).  
- Confirm you’re an **admin** on the Yuri Digital business and that you’ve selected the **correct** restricted WhatsApp account (check the account ID if several appear).  
- Try another browser or device, or disable ad-blockers, in case the page or buttons are not loading correctly.
